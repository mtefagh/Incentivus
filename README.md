# Welcome to _Project Incentivus_!

**Project Incentivus** is a new research initiative aiming to explore convex optimization applications to the incentive layer of blockchain protocols.

This interdisciplinary effort started from an earlier [work](https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838/24?u=mtefagh) on [EIP 1559](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1559-fee-market-change-for-eth-1-0-chain/2783/24?u=mtefagh). In summary, this EIP suggests an alternative to the current first-price auction transaction fee market. In this scheme, all of the transactions in a block share a universal fee; however, this fee is dynamically updated across different blocks according to a predetermined in-protocol formula. We started to look at a question relevant to all users: _what is the optimal policy to pay the minimum fee for executing a set of transactions?_ Such problems have long been investigated in economics and are frequently solved by convex optimization. In this case, the optimal policy turned out to be too optimal and could be considered an [attack](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mtefagh/fee/blob/master/fee.ipynb) in the sense that controlling the allocation of a small fraction of the total volume of transactions is enough to manipulate the price and make it zero in a short time.

Moreover, instead of searching for the optimal behavior given a specific protocol design, we can turn such arguments around to engineer user behaviors by setting the right incentives. A simple observation is that the transaction fee pricing problem is similar in many aspects to the liquidation strategies in economics. In the former case, we want to execute many transactions, but each time we do so, the price of executing the next transaction goes up. In the latter case, we want to sell our assets, but each time we do so, the trading price goes down. An established model for the second problem is the [Almgrenâ€“Chriss](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3473#issuecomment-479625462) framework, which guarantees that the optimal execution of transaction strategy is to spread the transactions across time which in turn helps to avoid network congestion for blockchains. Overall, we believe that although such use cases of convex optimization are exploited extensively in game theory, they have not transitioned to the blockchain ecosystem yet.
